#* Max length in bytes of a bus name, interface, or member (not object

#  be an exploit.
# 
#* This one is 255 so it fits in a byte 
#* Max length of a match rule string; to keep people from hosing the
#  daemon with some huge rule
# 
#* Max arg number you can match on in a match rule, e.g.
#  arg0='hello' is OK, arg3489720987='hello' is not
# 
#* Max length of a marshaled array in bytes (64M, 2^26) We use signed
#  int for lengths so must be INT_MAX or less.  We need something a
#  bit smaller than INT_MAX because the array is inside a message with
#  header info, etc.  so an INT_MAX array wouldn't allow the message
#  overhead.  The 64M number is an attempt at a larger number than
#  we'd reasonably ever use, but small enough that your bus would chew
#  through it fairly quickly without locking up forever. If you have
#  data that's likely to be larger than this, you should probably be
#  sending it in multiple incremental messages anyhow.
# 
#* Number of bits you need in an unsigned to store the max array size 
#* The maximum total message size including header and body; similar
#  rationale to max array size.
# 
#* Number of bits you need in an unsigned to store the max message size 
#* The maximum total number of unix fds in a message. Similar
#  rationale as DBUS_MAXIMUM_MESSAGE_LENGTH. However we divide by four
#  given that one fd is an int and hence at least 32 bits.
# 
#* Number of bits you need in an unsigned to store the max message unix fds 
#* Depth of recursion in the type tree. This is automatically limited
#  to DBUS_MAXIMUM_SIGNATURE_LENGTH since you could only have an array
#  of array of array of ... that fit in the max signature.  But that's
#  probably a bit too large.
# 
# Types of message 
#* This value is never a valid message type, see dbus_message_get_type() 
#* Message type of a method call message, see dbus_message_get_type() 
#* Message type of a method return message, see dbus_message_get_type() 
#* Message type of an error reply message, see dbus_message_get_type() 
#* Message type of a signal message, see dbus_message_get_type() 
# Header flags 
#* If set, this flag means that the sender of a message does not care about getting
#  a reply, so the recipient need not send one. See dbus_message_set_no_reply().
# 
#*
#  If set, this flag means that even if the message bus knows how to start an owner for
#  the destination bus name (see dbus_message_set_destination()), it should not
#  do so. If this flag is not set, the bus may launch a program to process the
#  message.
# 
# Header fields 
#* Not equal to any valid header field code 
#* Header field code for the path - the path is the object emitting a signal or the object receiving a method call.
#  See dbus_message_set_path().
# 
#* Header field code for the interface containing a member (method or signal).
#  See dbus_message_set_interface().
# 
#* Header field code for a member (method or signal). See dbus_message_set_member(). 
#* Header field code for an error name (found in #DBUS_MESSAGE_TYPE_ERROR messages).
#  See dbus_message_set_error_name().
# 
#* Header field code for a reply serial, used to match a #DBUS_MESSAGE_TYPE_METHOD_RETURN message with the
#  message that it's a reply to. See dbus_message_set_reply_serial().
# 
#*
#  Header field code for the destination bus name of a message. See dbus_message_set_destination().
# 
#*
#  Header field code for the sender of a message; usually initialized by the message bus.
#  See dbus_message_set_sender().
# 
#*
#  Header field code for the type signature of a message.
# 
#*
#  Header field code for the number of unix file descriptors associated
#  with this message.
# 
#*
#  Value of the highest-numbered header field code, can be used to determine
#  the size of an array indexed by header field code. Remember though
#  that unknown codes must be ignored, so check for that before
#  indexing the array.
# 
#* Header format is defined as a signature:
#    byte                            byte order
#    byte                            message type ID
#    byte                            flags
#    byte                            protocol version
#    uint32                          body length
#    uint32                          serial
#    array of struct (byte,variant)  (field name, value)
# 
#  The length of the header can be computed as the
#  fixed size of the initial data, plus the length of
#  the array at the end, plus padding to an 8-boundary.
# 

#*
#  The smallest header size that can occur.  (It won't be valid due to
#  missing required header fields.) This is 4 bytes, two uint32, an
#  array length. This isn't any kind of resource limit, just the
#  necessary/logical outcome of the header signature.
# 
# Errors 
# WARNING these get autoconverted to an enum in dbus-glib.h. Thus,
#  if you change the order it breaks the ABI. Keep them in order.
#  Also, don't change the formatting since that will break the sed
#  script.
# 
#* A generic error; "something went wrong" - see the error message for more. 
#* There was not enough memory to complete an operation. 
#* The bus doesn't know how to launch a service to supply the bus name you wanted. 
#* The bus name you referenced doesn't exist (i.e. no application owns it). 
#* No reply to a message expecting one, usually means a timeout occurred. 
#* Something went wrong reading or writing to a socket, for example. 
#* A D-Bus bus address was malformed. 
#* Requested operation isn't supported (like ENOSYS on UNIX). 
#* Some limited resource is exhausted. 
#* Security restrictions don't allow doing what you're trying to do. 
#* Authentication didn't work. 
#* Unable to connect to server (probably caused by ECONNREFUSED on a socket). 
#* Certain timeout errors, possibly ETIMEDOUT on a socket.
#  Note that #DBUS_ERROR_NO_REPLY is used for message reply timeouts.
#  @warning this is confusingly-named given that #DBUS_ERROR_TIMED_OUT also exists. We can't fix
#  it for compatibility reasons so just be careful.
# 
#* No network access (probably ENETUNREACH on a socket). 
#* Can't bind a socket since its address is in use (i.e. EADDRINUSE). 
#* The connection is disconnected and you're trying to use it. 
#* Invalid arguments passed to a method call. 
#* Missing file. 
#* Existing file and the operation you're using does not silently overwrite. 
#* Method name you invoked isn't known by the object you invoked it on. 
#* Object you invoked a method on isn't known. 
#* Interface you invoked a method on isn't known by the object. 
#* Property you tried to access isn't known by the object. 
#* Property you tried to set is read-only. 
#* Certain timeout errors, e.g. while starting a service.
#  @warning this is confusingly-named given that #DBUS_ERROR_TIMEOUT also exists. We can't fix
#  it for compatibility reasons so just be careful.
# 
#* Tried to remove or modify a match rule that didn't exist. 
#* The match rule isn't syntactically valid. 
#* While starting a new process, the exec() call failed. 
#* While starting a new process, the fork() call failed. 
#* While starting a new process, the child exited with a status code. 
#* While starting a new process, the child exited on a signal. 
#* While starting a new process, something went wrong. 
#* We failed to setup the environment correctly. 
#* We failed to setup the config parser correctly. 
#* Bus name was not valid. 
#* Service file not found in system-services directory. 
#* Permissions are incorrect on the setuid helper. 
#* Service file invalid (Name, User or Exec missing). 
#* Tried to get a UNIX process ID and it wasn't available. 
#* Tried to get a UNIX process ID and it wasn't available. 
#* A type signature is not valid. 
#* A file contains invalid syntax or is otherwise broken. 
#* Asked for SELinux security context and it wasn't available. 
#* Asked for AppArmor security context and it wasn't available. 
#* Asked for ADT audit data and it wasn't available. 
#* There's already an object with the requested object path. 
#* The message meta data does not match the payload. e.g. expected
#    number of file descriptors were not sent over the socket this message was received on. 
# XML introspection format 
#* XML namespace of the introspection format version 1.0 
#* XML public identifier of the introspection format version 1.0 
#* XML system identifier of the introspection format version 1.0 
#* XML document type declaration of the introspection format version 1.0

#  @defgroup DBus D-Bus low-level public API
#  @brief The low-level public API of the D-Bus library
# 
#  libdbus provides a low-level C API intended primarily for use by
#  bindings to specific object systems and languages.  D-Bus is most
#  convenient when used with the GLib bindings, Python bindings, Qt
#  bindings, Mono bindings, and so forth.  This low-level API has a
#  lot of complexity useful only for bindings.
# 
#  @{
# 
#* @} 
#*
#  @mainpage
# 
#  This manual documents the <em>low-level</em> D-Bus C API. <b>If you use
#  this low-level API directly, you're signing up for some pain.</b>
# 
#  Caveats aside, you might get started learning the low-level API by reading
#  about @ref DBusConnection and @ref DBusMessage.
# 
#  There are several other places to look for D-Bus information, such
#  as the tutorial and the specification; those can be found at <a
#  href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">the D-Bus
#  website</a>. If you're interested in a sysadmin or package
#  maintainer's perspective on the dbus-daemon itself and its
#  configuration, be sure to check out the man pages as well.
# 
#  The low-level API documented in this manual deliberately lacks
#  most convenience functions - those are left up to higher-level libraries
#  based on frameworks such as GLib, Qt, Python, Mono, Java,
#  etc. These higher-level libraries (often called "D-Bus bindings")
#  have features such as object systems and main loops that allow a
#  <em>much</em> more convenient API.
# 
#  The low-level API also contains plenty of clutter to support
#  integration with arbitrary object systems, languages, main loops,
#  and so forth. These features add a lot of noise to the API that you
#  probably don't care about unless you're coding a binding.
# 
#  This manual also contains docs for @ref DBusInternals "D-Bus internals",
#  so you can use it to get oriented to the D-Bus source code if you're
#  interested in patching the code. You should also read the
#  file HACKING which comes with the source code if you plan to contribute to
#  D-Bus.
# 
#  As you read the code, you can identify internal D-Bus functions
#  because they start with an underscore ('_') character. Also, any
#  identifier or macro that lacks a DBus, dbus_, or DBUS_ namepace
#  prefix is internal, with a couple of exceptions such as #NULL,
#  #TRUE, and #FALSE.
#
